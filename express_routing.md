# Routing
refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.

You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function (See Using middleware for details).
